## Bisection Method

To find a root very accurately Bisection Method is used in Mathematics. Bisection method algorithm is very easy to program and it always converges which means it always finds root.

Bisection Method repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which root lies. It is a very simple and robust method but slower than other methods.

It is also called Interval halving, binary search method and dichotomy method.

Bisection Method calculates the root by first calculating the mid point of the given interval end points.
